This repository contains all files related to simulating a serial connection over UART directly from the raspberry PI TX / RX pins.  Note that in order to make this work properly, you must (currently) first enable the usage of these ports.  For the raspberry PI, that requires moving or disabling bluetooth, and removing console support.  You may also need to ensure (for reading from the port) that you have a level shifter as the PI operates at 3.3v and many flight controllers send data at 5v.
